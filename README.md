# HarOnline

HarOnline is a website developed as an assignment for the WEB subject of my university. The user couldupload an .har file and the app would analyse it and show the user the geo locations of all the places his browser had made requests. Also developed an admin dashboard including statistics about the system itself.

## How to use

Donwload and extract the repo. You will also need to set up a mongoDB database where the har files will be stored containing 2 Collections (Users, Entries)
